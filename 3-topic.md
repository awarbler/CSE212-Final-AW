# Binary Tree

A binary tree is a type of data structure that is nonlinear with a hierarchical relationship between elements without having a cycle. It is connected with edges.
A binary tree can be used in a caf√© situation in a real-life case. On the menu, drinks are separated into hot beverages and cold beverages.

## Purpose

Binary trees are easier and quicker to access data.

## Terminology

Table 1.2 explains the basic definitions for Linked List
|     Term    |     Definition    |
|---|---|
|     Base category    |  It is the first category   |
|     Child Node    |    It is under the parent node   |
|     Edge    |    It is the link between the parent and the child   |
|     Leaf   |    Is a node that does not have a child   |
|     Parent Node    |     It is the first node in a subcategory  |
|     Root Node    |     The first Node does not have a parent |
|     Sibling  |   Is the children of the same parent  |
|     Depth  |   The length of the path of the root to the node  |
|     Height  |   The length of the path from the root to the deepest node   |

## Operations

|     Term    |     Definition    |
|---|---|
|     Insert    |     Add a node to any location, beginning, middle, end    |
|     Traversal    |     Traverse all of the nodes from beginning to end.    |
|     Searching    |     Search the value of an element    |
|     deletion    |     Remove a node from the list.         |
|     Sort    |     Sort the Node of the linked list.    |

## Examples

```python
 def __init__(self, data, children = []):
        self.data = data
        self.children = children
    
    def __str__(self, level=0):
        ret = "  " * level + str(self.data)  + "\n"
        for child in self.children:
            ret += child.__str__(level + 1)
        return ret
    
    def addChild(self, TreeNode):
        self.children.append(TreeNode)

```

## Problem

We found a sibling in our family history tree and we need to add it to the correct parents.

### Before Coding

- List test cases and their answers
- Consider the problems.
- Evaluate your code against all test cases
- Do not Rush to Code
- Make code simple and shortcode
- Sketch everything on paper first
- Draw out sketches
- Pick out clear names
- Reuse code
- In the algorithm, make sure you handle all run time errors in logic
- Verifying against null nodes
- Data integrity
  - What is your data? Head, Tail, length
    - Head and tail should be null or none if empty
    - Length must be the length of the items
  - Write a function that verifies a linked list is correct
    - if self.length == 0; assert self.head is none same for tail then return
    - check to assert self.tail.next is none
    - If self.length is equal to 1, assert head to equal tail
    - if self.length is equal to 2 assert head.next to equal tail
